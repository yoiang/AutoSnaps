# AutoSnaps
Snap a photo, save it off and close

AutoSnaps was built for an ongoing project started in 2009 in which my computer takes a candid photo at startup of whatever is in front of the camera. For more information please visit the [project page](https://www.iangrossberg.com/play/#/autosnaps/).
